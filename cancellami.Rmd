## Wrang gapminder data using dplyr

We will use the read_csv() function from the readr package

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)


## read gapminder csv. Note the readr:: prefix identifies which package it's in
gapminder <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv') 

head(gapminder) # shows first 6
tail(gapminder) # shows last 6

head(gapminder, 10) # shows first X that you indicate
tail(gapminder, 12) # guess what this does!
```

```{r}
str(gapminder) # ?str - displays the structure of an object
```
```{r}
names(gapminder)
dim(gapminder)    # ?dim dimension
ncol(gapminder)   # ?ncol number of columns
nrow(gapminder)   # ?nrow number of rows
```
```{r}
summary(gapminder)


library(skimr) # install.packages('skimr')
skim(gapminder)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img 1.png") ##per includere immagini
```

```{r}
head(gapminder)

```
What was the average life expectency in Brazil between 1987 and 2007?

```{r}
br<-filter(gapminder, country=="Brazil")
mean(br$lifeExp)
```

I’ve advised you to think “gets” whenever you see the assignment operator, <-. Similarly, you should think “and then” whenever you see the pipe operator, %>%.

###Exercise 1

Calculate the population in thousands for all Asian countries in the year 2007 and add it as a new column.

Then, sync to Github.com (pull, stage, commit, push).
```{r}
asian<-gapminder %>% 
          filter(continent=="Asia", year=="2007" ) %>%
          mutate(sum(pop))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
